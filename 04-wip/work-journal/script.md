# Script

https://www.prisma.io/

```sh
npm install --save-dev prisma
npm install @prisma/client
```

```sh
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
```

- VSCode extension

```prisma
// prisma.schema
model Entry {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  date      DateTime
  type  String
  text      String
}
```

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

```sh
npx prisma studio
```

ðŸ’¿ Let's add that prisma/dev.db to our .gitignore so we don't accidentally commit it to our repository. We'll also want to add the .env file to the .gitignore as mentioned in the prisma output so we don't commit our secrets!

- you can always delete dev.db, rerun npx prisma db push

```
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
const db = new PrismaClient();
```

db limit

```js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

let db: PrismaClient;

declare global {
  var __db: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

// this is needed because in development we don't want to restart
// the server with every change, but we want to make sure we don't
// create a new connection to the DB with every change either.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  db = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.__db) {
    global.__db = new PrismaClient();
  }
  db = global.__db;
}

export { db };
```

now

```js
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

let db = new PrismaClient();
```

PrismaClient is unable to be run in the browser error.

Move `db` to action. Notice error goes away.
