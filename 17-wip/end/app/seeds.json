When the weekend came I knew it'd be too much to try to squeeze in, so I listened to my body and gave myself permission to rest. Ended up having a glorious beach day on Sunday. Still working on finding balance during quarantine + excited to get this video up next week.",

            "In my ongoing quest to understand useEffect, I asked a question on Twitter about when a function parameter needs to be invoked inside of an effect. I'm still not confident about any of the answers, but Chris Freeman shared this great article with me on Potentially-Pure Functions. It seems that in a language like JavaScript, the purity of a function can depend on the purity of its arguments. The reason I'm spending so much time trying to understand this is because of this 2019 tweet from Sebastian. I'm still not sure how much this stuff matters outside of a CM/Suspense world."

We automerge in-range dependency updates, so the Netlify preview builds for Dependabot PRs were literally going unused. I learned that you can tell Netlify not to build a PR if the commit message has \"[skip netlify]\" in it, so I customized our Dependabot config to add this â€“ and it worked! Still need to smooth this out a bit as the builds are ignored when merged to master, but for now it is helping alleviate the problem. Check out the for our current config."
